# Strawberry Robot

The project demostrates an agriculture robot for children and students. 

## Requried hardware and software
* A robotic arm (I use 6 DOF arm from https://www.pinecone.ai/)
* A computer (I use Raspberry Pi 400 https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/ )
* Python
* OpenCV (opencv-python package)

Please read source file 'pick-strawberry.py' for details. You need to modify it a bit according to your environment especially your robotic arm.
